              <br>

              <div>
                <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds was born on 28th December 1969 in Helsinki. He comes from a family of journalists. His father Nils Torvalds is a Finnish politician and perhaps president candidate in the next elections.

                  He was named after Linus Pauling, a double Nobel prize winner in Chemistry and Peace.

              <div>
                <p>While you may find several people with the name Linus, you won’t find many people with the name Torvalds. Because the ‘correct’ spelling is actually Torvald (without s). His grandfather changed his name from Torvald to Torvalds, adding an ‘s’ at the end. And thus the Torvalds dynasty began (if I can call it that).

                  Since this is an unusual surname, there are hardly 30 Torvalds in the world and they are all relatives, claims Linus Torvalds in his biography.

                <p>In early 1991, unhappy with the MS-DOS and MINIX, 
                  Torvalds wanted to buy a UNIX system. Luckily for us,
                   he didn’t have enough money. So he decided to make his own clone of UNIX, from scratch.

                <p>
                  In Sep’91, Linus announced Linux (Linus’s MINIX) and encouraged 
                  his colleagues to use the source code for wider distribution.

                  Linus thought that the name Linux was too egotistical. 
                  He wanted to change it to Freax (Free, freak and MINIX) 
                  but his friend Lemmarke has already created a directory called Linux 
                  on his FTP server. And thus the name Linux continued.

                  In 1993, when he was teaching at the University of Helsinki, 
                  he gave the task of composing email as homework to the students. 
                  Yeah! composing emails were a big deal back then.

                  A female student named Tove Monni completed the task by sending 
                  him an email asking him out on a date. He accepted and three years 
                  later first of their three daughters was born.

                  Shall I say he started the internet dating trend? Hmm… Nah! let’s leave it there ;)

                  Linux is a trademark registered with Linus Torvalds.
                   Torvalds didn’t care about the trademark initially but in August, 
                   1994, a William R. Della Croce, Jr. registered the Linux trademark 
                   and started demanding royalties from Linux developers. Torvalds sued
                    him in return and in 1997, the case was settled.
