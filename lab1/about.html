              <h3> Named after a Noble prize winner </h3>
              <div>
                <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds was born on 28th December 1969 in Helsinki. He comes from a family of journalists. His father Nils Torvalds is a Finnish politician and perhaps president candidate in the next elections.

                  He was named after Linus Pauling, a double Nobel prize winner in Chemistry and Peace.

              <h3> All the Torvalds in the world are relatives </h3>
              <div>
                <p>While you may find several people with the name Linus, you won’t find many people with the name Torvalds. Because the ‘correct’ spelling is actually Torvald (without s). His grandfather changed his name from Torvald to Torvalds, adding an ‘s’ at the end. And thus the Torvalds dynasty began (if I can call it that).

                  Since this is an unusual surname, there are hardly 30 Torvalds in the world and they are all relatives, claims Linus Torvalds in his biography.

                <p>At the age of 10, Linus started writing programs in 
                  BASIC on his maternal grandfather’s Commodore Vic 20. 
                  This is when he discovered his love for computers and programming.
